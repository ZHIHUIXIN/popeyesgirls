**Abstract**
#The domain of our project is movie. Our goal is to use the data we get from the internet (social media, web scraper, API, raw data, twitter, Instagram, etc.) to build a database which include movie information, actor/actress Instagram data, movie recommend twitter account’s tweet data, Oscar winner’s data, etc. Also, we are going to create a newsfeed as an interface to query this data.

#Movie, database, social media, movie information

**I. Introduction**
When user input an old movie name or an actor name, we do some algorithm by connecting the data tables, then returns an in-theater movie that the user may want to see, at the same time show some related comments or recent news. 

People now really love watching movie on internet. Some people have specific aim of what to watch, other people have no idea and they really want to watch movies to relax. 

They might have favorite actors/actress, but they don’t really know what movies they play, and sometimes people just want to watch special genre like action/comedy. So we build the database of movies, and people could search by genre/actors/title. The database will help people find some related movies. It helps people to make a better choice.
